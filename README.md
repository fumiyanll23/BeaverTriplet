# BeaverTriplet

In 1992, Donald Beaver, a researcher of AT&T laboratories, proposed a secure computation (especially multiplication) by secret sharing in the thesis ["Efficient Multiparty Protocols Using Circuit Randomization"](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/3-540-46766-1_34.pdf).
His method has been called "Beaver Triplet".
In this repository, I implemented Beaver Triplet in Python and I generalized for multiplicating matrix and matrix.
I wish these codes will make you happy ;)
